This document describes the test data release for the SemEval-2010 Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation Task #14. 


The top level folder, i.e. <test_data> contains three subfolders:

a.) <verbs> - This folder contains 50 xml files. Each xml file consists of a set of instances of a polysemous target verb. The senses of a particular target verb senses should have been induced by a participating system using the training data. 

The following table shows the target verbs and the number of instances for each one.

b.) nouns - This folder contains 50 xml files. Each xml file consists of a set of instances of a polysemous target noun. The senses of a particular target noun senses should have been induced by a participating system using the training data.

=========================

Note that in contrast to the trial test data, in this release we have added an extra XML element to each instance of a target word (noun or verb), as the following example shows.

 <access.n.1>
 The port is famous for wind shelter , deep water , non-accumulation of mud and sand , short sea - routes and long , usable coastline .  
  <TargetSentence>
  In more than four years , 2.2 billion yuan has been invested in the construction of harbors and docks , storage fields , support facilities and infrastructure of the ports and city , creating good conditions for building access to   the sea for the Great Southwest .  
  </TargetSentence>
 Currently , there are 25 berths in the whole city , of which 10 berths are of 10,000 ton level .  
</access.n.1>

This modification was done in order to help participants distinguish between the sentence in which the target word appears and its surrounding context.

Participants are required to tag (disambiguate) each instance of a target word (noun or verb) with one of its induced senses (assuming that the senses have been learned using the training dataset).

The output of systems should follow the usual Senseval-3 & SemEval-2007 WSI task format. The labels for learned senses can be arbitrary symbols. Please note that the labels of each induced sense must be unique. 

For instance, assume that one participant system has induced 2 senses for the verb "absorb", i.e. absorb.cluster.1 and absorb.cluster.2.  These are example outputs for two instances of the word absorb:
		
absorb.v absorb.v.1 absorb.cluster.1 
absorb.v absorb.v.2 absorb.cluster.1/0.8 absorb.cluster.2/0.2

In the first line the system assigns sense absorb.cluster.1 to instance absorb.v.1 with weight 1 (default). 
In the second line the system assigns to instance absorb.v.2  i.) sense absorb.cluster.1 with weight equal to 0.8 and ii.) sense absorb.cluster.2 with weight equal to 0.2.
We recommend that participants return all induced senses per instance with associated weights, as this will enable a more objective supervised evaluation. 

Participants should upload one file containing their answers to the SemEval website (http://semeval2.fbk.eu/semeval2.php?location=login_user) on or before April 2nd.
